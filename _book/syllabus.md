**Course description:**

Contemporary research in analytical geography has placed an increasing
demand on the computational skills of its practitioners. The advances in
spatial data analysis and geographical modeling have also largely
out-paced the capabilities of standard statistical software. At the same
time, the multidisciplinary nature of the spatial sciences often
translates into the need to deal with disparate data sources, formats
and programming languages. As such, students undertaking research are
often confronted with a daunting set of tasks that are seldom covered in
an integrated fashion in course work. This course is designed to address
this situation.



**Course learning outcomes:**

* Introduce geography students to basic computational concepts using
Python, an object-oriented scripting language, for data processing,
analysis and application development in geographic research.

* Familiarize students with the fundamental tools used in collaborative
programming and research projects in an open source and cross-platform
environment.

* Provide students with skill sets that are in high demand within academic
GIScience and commercial GIS development.

**Grading policy:**



Grading in the course will be based on the following point system:


| **Component**                        | **Points**                           |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 12 Exercises                         | 360                                  |
| Exam 1                               | 120                                  |
| Exam 2                               | 220                                  |
| Exam 3                               | 300                                  |
| Total                                | 1000                                 |

**Exams** will be based on the readings, discussion forum posts, and exercises. All exams are cumulative.  Late exams will not be accepted.

**Exercises** will be completed and submitted on Github.

**Extra credit** will be given for accepted pull requests that provide corrections or enhancements to course materials. 10 points for each accepted pull request.

**Academic integrity**

The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment,
plagiarizing, academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information,
aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately
collaborating, or falsifying academic records. For more information
